Hi, I'm Mark :wave:. I'm a technology enthusiast and CTO at [Clef](https://getclef.com), a security company based in Oakland, CA. 

I'm interested in building technology that empowers people instead of
manipulating them.

Lately, I've been making stuff (like this website) with [Swift](https://swift.org/) and
[Clojure](http://clojure.org/).
