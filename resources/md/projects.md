## Projects

### WIP

I maintain a handful of open source libraries that support these and other projects. I'm also interested in generative art, most recently with an [HP-7550A](http://hpmuseum.net/display_item.php?hw=75) pen plotter. See [GitHub](https://github.com/landakram?tab=repositories) for these and other hidden gems.

### Previous

* <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108070329/https://getclef.com/" target=_blank>Clef</a> was a better way to log in online. Twilio acquired our team in 2017.
* <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/instant-2fa" target=_blank>Instant2FA</a> was a drop-in 2FA integration, built during the Clef days.
* <a href="https://github.com/landakram/gdax_recurring" target=_blank>gdax_recurring</a> is a CLI tool to automate recurring USD deposits and asset allocation for GDAX (now Coinbase Pro). It theoretically still works, but I haven't used it in years.
