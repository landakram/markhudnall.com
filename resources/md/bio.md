Hi, I'm Mark ðŸ‘‹

I'm interested in technology -- how we use it and how it shapes us.

Previously, I worked at [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com), doing payments engineering and backend platform work. Before that, I was the CTO of Clef, a security company based in Oakland, CA. We let you log in to websites using digital signatures instead of passwords or one-time tokens.
