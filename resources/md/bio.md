Hi, I'm Mark 👋

I'm an engineer, people manager, and founder interested in empowering technologies.

I was an engineer and people manager at [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com), focusing on payments and backend platform. Before that, I was a founder and CTO of Clef, building a better way to log in online.
