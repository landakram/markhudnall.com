Hi, I'm Mark ðŸ‘‹. 

I'm interested in technology -- how we use it and how it shapes us.

I'm the CTO of [Clef](https://getclef.com), a security company based in Oakland, CA. We log you in to websites using digital signatures instead of passwords or one-time tokens.

When I'm not doing that, I climb rocks, read books, and enjoy programming as a hobby. Lately, I've been making things with [Swift](https://swift.org/) and [Clojure](http://clojure.org/).
