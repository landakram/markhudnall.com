Title: Try
Date: 2015-05-19

I tie my self-worth to what I do and whether I succeed. I call this the *“Do or do not, there is no try”* philosophy.[^1]

But I can spend all day *doing* without really *trying*. When it comes to my self-worth, the more important philosophy is simpler:

*Try.*

When I follow the *“Do or do not”* philosophy, I pin my self-worth to whether I did something or didn’t, however improbable the odds of success. I end up judging myself by things that are out of my control. When the odds aren’t in my favor, I become afraid to even begin.

When I *try*, I’m pushed to my limit, which isn’t always far enough to succeed.

In other words, I fail.

At so many things.

When I try and fail, I learn. When I learn, I get better.

*Doing* has never been the destination, but rather, the false means I’ve come up with to achieve a truer goal: to live with myself and love myself.

*Trying* never purports to be a destination, but it leads me… *somewhere*. It brings into focus my edges, the uncomfortable demarcations of territory where beyond is what I can be, but am not yet.

As my edges become clear, I can begin to truly know them: winding coastlines formed of insecurity, doubt. I can poke and prod them and find their soft spots. I can accept them and love them as parts of me, as integral as my skills or confidence or *doings*.

And I can keep pushing.
