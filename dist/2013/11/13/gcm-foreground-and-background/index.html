A lot has changed since then! Take these words with a grain of salt and some patience with past me, who no longer exists.</p></fieldset><p>When the <a href='https://getclef.com'>Clef</a> Android app gets notifications, we want it to behave differently when it's open and in the foreground than when it's in the background.</p><p>This is a surprisingly difficult thing to do, since it's actually quite difficult to determine whether an app is in the background. You can use a static boolean or keep track of the shown activity (maybe in a custom <code>Application</code> class or another singleton), but that isn't always reliable. You might also have other requirements—what if you want to differentiate behavior based on which activity is in the foreground?</p><p>One <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/a/15949723/826650'>solution</a> is <code>sendOrderedBroadcast</code>, but I prefer something with a little less boilerplate.</p><h2 id="all&#95;aboard&#95;the&#95;event&#95;bus">All aboard the event bus</h2><p>Instead of using <code>BroadcastReceivers</code>, we can use an event bus like <a href='http://square.github.io/otto/'>Otto</a> or <a href='https://github.com/greenrobot/EventBus'>EventBus</a> to notify activities about an incoming GCM message. If no activities are registered on the bus, we can correctly place a notification in the notification drawer.</p><p>If you aren't familiar with event buses, the idea is simple. Any object (usually an <code>Activity</code>) can register with (or as I like to say, ride) the event bus:</p><pre><code>bus.register&#40;this&#41;;
</code></pre><p>The object then provides subscriber methods to run when the bus emits an event:</p><pre><code>public void onEvent&#40;NotificationEvent event&#41; {
    Toast.makeText&#40;this, 
        event.payload.getString&#40;&quot;message&quot;&#41;, 
        LENGTH&#95;SHORT&#41;
    .show&#40;&#41;;
}
</code></pre><p>When an object should stop riding the event bus, you can unregister it:</p><pre><code>bus.unregister&#40;this&#41;;
</code></pre><p>To actually emit events:</p><pre><code>NotificationEvent event = new NotificationEvent&#40;bundle&#41;;
bus.post&#40;event&#41;;
</code></pre><p>This triggers a call to the <code>onEvent&#40;NotificationEvent event&#41;</code> method in every object registered on the bus. You can add different subscriber methods (such as <code>onEvent&#40;LocationEvent event&#41;</code>) and these method will only be run when an event of the same type is emitted (<code>bus.post&#40;new LocationEvent&#40;&#41;&#41;</code>) There is no limit to how many objects can register with the bus.</p><p>If there are no objects registered, a second event is automatically posted. With Otto, this event is called <code>DeadEvent</code>. With EventBus, it's called <code>NoSubscriberEvent</code>. This lets you separately handle cases where there are no subscribers (you might see where this is going).</p><p>You can also post any object. I like to create classes that logically separate events and suffix them with <code>Event</code>. For instance, the <code>NotificationEvent</code> class looks like this:</p><pre><code>public class NotificationEvent {
    public Bundle payload;

    public NotificationEvent&#40;Bundle extras&#41; {
        this.payload = extras;
    }
}
</code></pre><h3 id="otto&#95;and&#95;eventbus">Otto and EventBus</h3><p>These libraries are very similar. <a href='http://square.github.io/otto/'>Otto</a> uses annotations (<code>@Subscribe</code>) to determine which subscriber methods to run, while <a href='https://github.com/greenrobot/EventBus'>EventBus</a> uses a consistent method name (<code>onEvent</code>).</p><p>Unfortunately, both libraries have drawbacks. Otto <a href='https://github.com/square/otto/issues/83'>doesn't let you</a> register with the bus in a superclass and receive events in a subclass. This is annoying if you'd like to register in a <code>BaseActivity</code> that all of your activities extend from.</p><p>EventBus has a bug when trying to subscribe to the <code>NoSubscriberEvent</code>. If you register and unregister an object, the event never fires. Bummer. There's a <a href='https://github.com/greenrobot/EventBus/pull/32'>pull request</a> that adds a <em>one line fix</em>, but the maintainers haven't touched it yet.</p><p>I ended up choosing EventBus because I really wanted to be able to register with the bus in a base class<a href='#fn-1' id='fnref1'><sup>1</sup></a>, but again, they are basically the same for most purposes. I did have to add the patch in <a href='https://github.com/greenrobot/EventBus/pull/32'>this pull request</a> to make it work.</p><h2 id="changing&#95;app&#95;behavior&#95;for&#95;gcm&#95;messages">Changing app behavior for GCM messages</h2><p>Here's how we use an event bus to do different things when the app is in the foreground or background.</p><p>We use a singleton event bus. The EventBus library provides one for you with <code>EventBus.getInstance&#40;&#41;</code>. It's also easy to make a singleton bus with Otto—you can even use <a href='https://github.com/square/dagger/'>Dagger</a> to inject the global bus where needed (to truly Square-ify your code).</p><p>Every activity registers with the bus when it is shown and unregisters when it is hidden. This ensures that only one activity receives events from the bus at a time. We also add a subscriber method to handle the notification. We accomplish this with a base class:</p><pre><code>public abstract class BaseActivity extends Activity {
    @Override
    public void onResume&#40;&#41; {
        super.onResume&#40;&#41;;
        EventBus.getInstance&#40;&#41;.register&#40;this&#41;;
    }
    
    @Override
    public void onPause&#40;&#41; {
        super.onPause&#40;&#41;;
        EventBus.getInstance&#40;&#41;.unregister&#40;this&#41;;
    }

    public void onEvent&#40;NotificationEvent notification&#41; {
        startActivity&#40;new Intent&#40;BaseActivity.this, NotificationActivity.class&#41;&#41;;
        overridePendingTransition&#40;R.anim.fade&#95;in&#95;animation, R.anim.fade&#95;out&#95;animation&#41;;
    }

}
</code></pre><p>Then, in our GCM Receiver, we post to the event bus:</p><pre><code>public class GcmReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {
    @Override
    public void onReceive&#40;Context context, Intent intent&#41; {
        GoogleCloudMessaging gcm = GoogleCloudMessaging.getInstance&#40;context&#41;;
        String gcmMessageType = gcm.getMessageType&#40;intent&#41;;
        if &#40;GoogleCloudMessaging.MESSAGE&#95;TYPE&#95;MESSAGE.equals&#40;gcmMessageType&#41;&#41; {
            Bundle payload = intent.getExtras&#40;&#41;;
            NotificationEvent notification = new NotificationEvent&#40;payload&#41;;

            // Register ourselves so we can receive the NoSubscriberEvent notification if no
            // activities are registered
            EventBus.getDefault&#40;&#41;.register&#40;this, NoSubscriberEvent.class&#41;;

            // Post the notification for an activity
            EventBus.getDefault&#40;&#41;.post&#40;notification&#41;;
        }
        setResultCode&#40;Activity.RESULT&#95;OK&#41;;
    }
</code></pre><p>The real magic happens in this line:</p><pre><code>    // Register ourselves so we can receive the NoSubscriberEvent notification if no
    // activities are registered
    EventBus.getDefault&#40;&#41;.register&#40;this, NoSubscriberEvent.class&#41;;
</code></pre><p>We register the <code>GcmReceiver</code> with the event bus to receive only the <code>NoSubscriberEvent</code>. If no activity is being displayed, then nothing is registered for <code>NotificationEvent</code>. EventBus will then post the <code>NoSubscriberEvent</code>, which we can handle in <code>GcmReceiver</code> like so:</p><pre><code>/&#42;
 &#42; Called when there are no subscribers to the NotificationEvent.
 &#42;
 &#42; This occurs when the app is in the background and no activities are riding the bus.
 &#42;/
public void onEvent&#40;NoSubscriberEvent deadEvent&#41; {
    // We're all done here
    EventBus.getDefault&#40;&#41;.unregister&#40;this&#41;;

    NotificationEvent notification = &#40;NotificationEvent&#41; deadEvent.originalEvent;

    // Save the wee little notification for later consumption by an activity
    Mailbox.getInstance&#40;&#41;.put&#40;notification&#41;;

    // Display the notification in the notification drawer
    buildNotification&#40;notification&#41;;
}
</code></pre><p><code>buildNotification</code> puts the notification in the notification drawer with a <a href='https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/PendingIntent.html'>PendingIntent</a>. We also save the notification in a global queue, so that when application is opened back up <em>not</em> from the notification drawer, we can process it as normal. There's probably a better solution than this, since it's possible for the <code>Mailbox</code> singleton to be deallocated when the app is in the background.</p><p>Both EventBus and Otto also support "sticky" events. Once you post an event with <code>postSticky</code>, EventBus caches it, so you can get the last event back with <code>bus.getStickyEvent&#40;TheEventClass.class&#41;</code>. Otto allows you to use a default value by defining a method with a <code>@Provides</code> annotation. In this example, sticky events could replace storing the notification away in <code>Mailbox</code>.</p><h3 id="differentiating&#95;notifications">Differentiating notifications</h3><p>Your app probably sends more than one kind of GCM message. If that's the case, you can subclass <code>NotificationEvent</code> to handle different message types. When you register an activity with the event bus, you can write your subscriber functions so they only respond to certain kinds of notifications. This is a nice way to use the built-in type system, instead of doing something like <code>payload.getString&#40;&quot;type&quot;&#41;.equals&#40;aMessageType&#41;</code> everywhere.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Event buses are awesome. There are many more use cases, such as communicating between fragments in a sane way (without using interfaces) or making callbacks from <code>AsyncTasks</code> (although, I prefer replacing <code>AsyncTask</code> <a href='http://markhudnall.com/2013/10/15/rxjava-and-android/'>with RxJava</a> altogether<a href='#fn-2' id='fnref2'><sup>2</sup></a>).</p><ol class='footnotes'><li id='fn-1'>Though there is a <a href='http://howrobotswork.wordpress.com/2013/07/20/subclassing-with-otto/'>workaround</a> for Otto.<a href='#fnref1'>&#8617;</a></li><li id='fn-2'>Event buses could actually replace RxJava for a lot of simpler use cases.
